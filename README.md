# The "scratch-puzzles" project
## openhome.school Computer Class

This project simply collects some Scratch "puzzles" - that is, pictures of Scratch constructs
intended for contemplation and reproduction.

## Puzzles

The puzzles are in separate files, to encourage repository exploration and keep class together.
They are here (below), as links, but one could simply click on the files, above, to view, as well.
